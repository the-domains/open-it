### **This will get you started**
![If you would rather pick which features you want or don't want as part of the installed software, you may wish to build from source code. Source packages tend to be in tar.gz files or similar and often require you to unpack the file and run "make" with arguments depending on what you want built.](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p118x118/13332783_1401609569864470_1381823970534320036_n.jpg?oh=77f9392862c9f5432e5b4393d3b44d1a&oe=5ADAC712)
