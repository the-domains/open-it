  The iPhone 4 received generally positive reception, with critics praising its
  revamped design and more powerful hardware in comparison to previous models.
  While it was a market success, with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours,
  the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports that
  abnormalities in its new antenna design caused the device to lose its cellular
  signal if held in a certain way.
